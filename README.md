## General Approach
I started by making an ERD diagram for this website. I wanted to visual see the tables as well as the relationships between the tables. Once I felt confident about the ERD diagram I implemented it into a monolithic backend. For me it was easier to start with a monolithic backend and then convert it to a microservice. The general flow when creating the backend went as follows: Models > Repositories > Services > Controller. After testing all endpoints I moved on to converting it to a microservice but I hit a roadblock. I was receiving a ton of errors throughout this process. So I then decided to start working on the React frontend. I worked on making sure that I made the correct fetch calls to connect my backend to the front while keeping in mind that there are two flows in the website depending on whether the user is new or returning.
